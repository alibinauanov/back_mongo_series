Frank and Ramon become rich overnight and Marly finds herself immersed in this wild and rapid transformation. The final years of the Cold War sparked a sense of hope and inspired a new generation to celebrate life to its fullest. Amsterdam became the center of that cultural revolution with a radically new form of music: house and a new love drug: XTC. The erotic phone lines offer the opportunity to experience anonymous sex in a new way, changing the morality of its consumers, but also very much the people creating it.",

It will be another kind of drama that will give you a sense of immersion and tension that you've never experienced before. The original author, Profiler Kwon Il Yong, became a police officer in 1989 and became the first profiler in Korea in 2000. His name was made public when he profiled serial killers such as Yoo Young Chul and Jung Nam Kyu. Kim Nam Gil will once again attempt a strong transformation by acting as a profiler of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's criminal behavior analysis team, which looks deeper into humans than anyone else and takes a more delicate look at others.",
